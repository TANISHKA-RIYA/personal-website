        <h1> Hi! </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
            <br>He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open source Solid platform.
            <br> Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning many assumptions about how the web has to work.
            <br> Solid technically is is new level of standard at the web layer, which adds things never put into the original spec, such as global single sign-on, universal access control, and a universal data API so that any app can store data in any
            storage place.
            <br>Socially Solid is a movement away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and toward a world in which users are in control, and empowered by large amounts of data, private, shared, and public.
            <br>Sir Tim is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards organization founded in 1994 which develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential.
